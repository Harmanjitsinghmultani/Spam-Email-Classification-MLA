# P3-Spam-mail-Classification-Using-NLP-And-MLA

# Project Description
This project focuses on developing a machine learning-based system to classify emails into **spam** or **ham** (non-spam). The solution utilizes a dataset from Kaggle, preprocessing it for textual analysis, and employs Logistic Regression for classification. The model is deployed as a web application using Flask, allowing users to input email content and receive real-time classification results.

Key Features:
- High accuracy (96%) on both training and test datasets.
- User-friendly web application for real-time spam detection.
- Scalable architecture designed for extensibility and performance.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handled missing values and cleaned the email text.
   - Encoded spam and ham labels numerically.
   - Split data into training (80%) and testing (20%) sets.

2. **Feature Extraction**:
   - Utilized **TF-IDF Vectorization** to convert textual data into numerical features.
   - Emphasized unique terms for accurate classification.

3. **Model Development**:
   - Trained a Logistic Regression model on the preprocessed data.
   - Achieved high accuracy through feature engineering and evaluation metrics.

4. **Deployment**:
   - Developed a web application using Flask.
   - Enabled users to input email text and receive spam/ham predictions.
